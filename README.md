<strong>ABOUT</strong><br>
<br>
Consumer financial complaints in the US for 2022 were primarily centered around credit score providers and banks. According to data, credit score providers such as Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion accounted for nearly 69 percent of all complaints during that year.

When excluding credit score providers and focusing on the remaining institutions, banks emerged as the main subject of consumer grievances. Major banks like Capital One, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and JP Morgan Chase dominated the US financial landscape. Among these banks, Capital One received the highest number of complaints in 2022.
